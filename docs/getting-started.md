EverÂ® Traduora is an Open-Source **Translation Management Platform**.

Once you set up your project, you can import and export your translations to various formats, work together with your team, instantly deliver translation updates over the air, and _soon_ automatically translate your project via third-party integrations.

We want Traduora to become the home for managing your translation workflow. That's why we have made all of the core products open-source, intending to grow a community and enable developers to build on top of it as a platform.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Please see our [step-by-step guide](screenshots.md) for Traduora.

## Try it out

Traduora can be run just about anywhere.  
For a 5 second quickstart simply run our example docker-compose setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ever-co/ever-traduora
cd ever-traduora
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yaml up
```

Now go to your browser on http://localhost:8080 and that's it!

Note: if you want to build docker image locally (instead of downloading prebuilt one), just run `docker-compose up` instead of `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yaml up`.

## Deployment and configuration

Please check out the [configuration](configuration.md) and [deployment](deployment.md) documents for more information on deploying Traduora.
